# EANBiT_Training
## Git and github practice
*git is an open source tool.very handy skill.*
### Let's begin

*first a code block to gauge your feeling*

```
#code block
if (happy)
print ":smiley:";
else
print "rage";
```

Here's a [Gihub pages](https://github.com/eanbit-rt2019), link to the actual EANBiT training repo, coz this is not it.

In the repo you'll find so much more. Like;
- genomic annotation staff
- advanced scripting staff
- even some workflow language info

So this should be :fire: :+1:

Enjoyyy!!
